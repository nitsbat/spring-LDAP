LDAP - LightWeight Directory Access Protocol
It is an application protocol over an IP network to manage and access the distributed directory information service.
Now the purpose of the directory service as we know is to provide a systematic set of records in a hierarchical way.
Record1 -> Record2 -> Record3

LDAP is basically designed to have more Read operations and less write operations.
Examples of LDAP resources are to add an employee , computer , printer.
The best usecase is storing Employee password and username.
Employee details storing username and password in LDAP server and using authentication against it cozz we know
that username and password will not change regularly and hence write operation is rare.

The most important is LDAP server where we store employee username and password.
Second we have to setup the LDAP client. here the client can be web application also.
The LDAP server is called Directory System Agent set up at port 389.
After the connection is established the client and server exchange packets of data and basic encoding rules are used
to transform the information between server and client.

Operations on LDAP - ADD an entry, DELETE an entry, BIND, MODIFY , UNBIND.
